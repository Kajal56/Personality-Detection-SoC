PERSONALITY DETECTION USING SOCIAL MEDIA

This repository contains the material we ([Varre Suman Chaitanya](https://github.com/SumanChaitanyaVarre/ "Suman Chaitanya") and [Kajal Malik](https://github.com/Kajal56/ )) learnt through the SoC project and our code for the project. 

DESCRIPTION:

  In our project, we try to combine both personality predictions using ML algorithms like Neural Networking and KMeans to predict the personality of a person to get the skill in which the person is good at. Users can easily identify his personality and his technical skill from this model or system.
  
MENTOR:

  Sohom Mandal and Advait Padhye
  
PROCEDURE: 
 
  1) Downloaded the required data sets from Kaggle.
  2) clustered the data into five categories using KMeans algorithm.
  3) Used Neural Networking on the new data to classify the new people into one of the above Catogeries.
  
SOFTWARES USED:

  Python, Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, Sklearn .
